The two folders contain the input files for ab initio (VASP) calculations.
A user should copy the POTCAR and write its own scripts for ab initio
calculations of the number of POSCARs. The output files train.cfg and test.cfg
contain training and test sets already computed with VASP
in our internal .cfg format.

The script calc-mindist.sh, unsurprisingly, calculates minimal distance between
atoms in the training and test sets. Also writes a per-configuration mindist
to the corresponding .cfg files.
