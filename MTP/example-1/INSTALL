1) Compile the mlp binary and copy it in this folder. Either MPI or serial
   version should work.

2) To calculate the elastic constants with LAMMPS, you should compile the
   LAMMPS+MLIP binary, rename it to "lmp", and copy it in this folder.
   The LAMMPS-MLIP interface is distributed at
   https://gitlab.com/ashapeev/interface-lammps-mlip-v2.

3) To recalculate the training set with VASP, copy the corresponding POTCAR
   to the folders "1.training_test_set/vasp_test_set" and
   "1.training_test_set/vasp_training_set".
   Write your own scripts for ab initio calculations of a multiple of POSCARs.
