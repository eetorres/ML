Scripts:
- lattice-parameter.sh: lattice parameter calculation
- energy-volume-curve.sh: energy-volume curve calculation
- read-cfgs-write-energy-volume.py: python script to extract the energy-volume
  pair from the CFG files

Input files:
- deformed.cfg: deformations of the unit cell for plotting
  the energy-volume curve
- init.cfg: undeformed configuration (input for structure relaxation)

Output files:
- deformed_efs_vasp.cfg: computed deformed configurations with VASP
- E_V_vasp.txt: processed volume-energy pairs for VASP
- example-1-E-V-curve.pdf: plot for the figure of Example 1, the uncertainty
  was evaluated on the ensemble of the five MTPs

Folders: 1/ - 5/: folders with potentials, relax.ini needed for relaxation,
and output files. In each folder:
- pot1.mtp - pot5.mtp: files with the fitted MTPs
- relax.ini: MLIP settings file for relaxation
- relaxed.cfg: the relaxed configuration (with the equilibrium lattice parameter)
- deformed_efs.cfg: files with energy for the defomed configurations
- E_V.txt: processed volume-energy pairs
