The two folders contain files for calculation of elastic constants with
finite differences and with LAMMPS.

The three files C11.csv, C12.csv, and C44.csv list the results of such
calculations, namely the elastic constants:
- calculated with DFT (using finite differences),
- MLIP (using finite diffences), and
- LAMMPS (it was run with MTPs fitted).
