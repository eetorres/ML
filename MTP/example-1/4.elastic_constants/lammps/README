The folders ElConst1-ElConst5 contain:
- the fitted MTPs
- additional files needed to calculate the elastic constants using the
  LAMMPS code with MTPs. The resulting constants are written in the
  file ElasticConstants.txt (using the python scripts read-ElasticConstants-create-file.py).

The shell script elastic-constants.sh calculates the elastic constants C11, C12, and C44.
