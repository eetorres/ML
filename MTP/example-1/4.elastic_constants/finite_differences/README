The five folders ElConst1-ElConst5 contain:
- the corresponding fitted MTPs
- the files 1.cfg-4.cfg including extended/compressed configurations along
  the directions xx and xy needed for calculation of the elastic constants
  C11, C12, and C44 with finite differences.

The shell script calc-efs-deformed-cfg.sh calculates energies, forces, and
stresses of the extended/compressed configurations and writes them in the files
1_efs.cfg-4_efs.cfg. Note that one could alternatively put all four
configurations in one file and process them at once.

The folder ElConstDFT has the files 1_efs.cfg-4_efs.cfg containing
extended/compressed configurations with energies, forces, and stresses,
calculated with DFT. Once we have all the files 1_efs.cfg-4_efs.cfg
we manually calculate the elastic constants with finite differences.
